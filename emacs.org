#+TITLE: Maxim's Emacs Config
#+AUHTOR: Maxim Rebguns

* Introduction
  I'm new to Emacs. This file is an attempt to make my Emacs config
  using literate programming with Org Mode and Org Babel. What this
  means is that all the code for my configuration is here, wrapped in
  =BEGIN_SRC= and =END_SRC=. This makes my config very readable and it
  can be published without an issue.

** How this works
   All the Org files in my Emacs directory are taken by =init.el= and
   transformed into Elisp files which are then loaded into Emacs. The
   following files can be found in my configuration:

   + =init.el= -- This script loads all literate Org files in the
     Emacs directory.
   + =emacs.org= -- This is my main configuration file---the one
     you're viewing right now.

* Package Loading
  Set up package sources and the system for loading packages further
  down in this document.
  
** Melpa
   Add [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]] to the to the list of sources.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
		  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
		  t)
     (package-initialize)
   #+END_SRC

** Set up use-package
   If [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is not installed, then do so.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
       (package-refresh-contents)
       (package-install 'use-package))
     (require 'use-package)
   #+END_SRC

   Make sure packages are automatically installed if they weren't
   already.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
   #+END_SRC

* Appearance
  Customize the appearance of Emacs with themes and disabling some
  default modes.

** Theme
  Set the theme to [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][Spacemacs]]. The original code I used by getting the
  theme with use-package and then setting it up with config didn't
  work. [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/issues/42#issuecomment-236437989][This GitHub comment proposed a solution that works.]]
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package spacemacs-common
      :ensure spacemacs-theme
      :init (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t))
  #+END_SRC

** UI Components
   With the new theme, UI components like the tool bar, menu bar and
   scrollbar are ugly. The following code removes them, leaving the
   menu bar up in terminal mode.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (scroll-bar-mode -1)
     ;; If running in a graphical display.
     (if (display-graphic-p)
	 (menu-bar-mode -1)
       (menu-bar-mode 1))
   #+END_SRC

* Functionality
  This section changes the Emacs functionality by customizing built-in
  configuration variables.
  
** Indentation
   I /hate/ the fact that Emacs "tabifies" text by default.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
   #+END_SRC
   
* Mode Configuration
  This section adds packages for various other modes not implemented
  in Emacs by default, such as the Markdown mode. It also defines
  configuration values for various emacs modes.

  
** CSS
   CSS Mode is built-in to emacs, but I like my CSS indent to be 2,
   but the default is 4, so I'm setting it to two here.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq-default css-indent-offset 2)
   #+END_SRC
   
** Markdown
   Markdown is implemented with [[https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode][markdown-mode]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package markdown-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** YAML
   The mode I use for YAML is [[https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode][yaml-mode]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package yaml-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** JavaScript
   For JS, I used the enhanced [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/][js2-mode]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package js2-mode
       :init (setq-default js-indent-level 2))
   #+END_SRC

** Org Mode
   This section customizes the pre-installed [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]], a tool for
   planning and note taking.

*** Org Babel
    This subsection customizes Org Babel, a tool in Org Mode that
    provides literate programming tools for code blocks.

    Load Python.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'ob-python)
    #+END_SRC
